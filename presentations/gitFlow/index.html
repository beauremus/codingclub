					</small>
				</h4>
				<aside class="notes">
					Caveat, I almost always work alone. I may not be aware of common issue using this strategy in a group. Also, this isn't a
					solution for every occasion. I often use a single branch.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Why?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Prevents orphaned files and branches</li>
					<li>Allows for easy, confident work on</li>
					<ul>
						<li>multiple features</li>
						<li>hot fixes</li>
						<li>deployment to the real world</li>
					</ul>
					<li>It can be reasoned about</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					Even when using versioning it can be easy to get lost. I often mindlessly make commits without thinking about the larger
					structure. You want to think about structure at breaking points. Working on multiple features at a time can lead to
					having orphaned files and unnecessary code comments to keep track of what you are doing.

					<h2>Development Branch</h2>
					<p>
						<small>Development branch is a comprehensive history of the project.</small>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						First thing we need to do is complement our master branch with a development branch. The names of the branches can be whatever
						makes most sense to you but this is the community convention.

					<h2>Master Branch</h2>
					<p>
						<small>The Master branch will hold all the public releases of the project.</small>

				<section>
					<h2>Feature Branches</h2>
					<p>
						<small>Feature branches start and end on the Development branch.</small>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration.
						But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete,
						it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master.

					<h2>Hotfix Branches</h2>
					<p>
						<small>
							Hotfixes are branched from master to be fixed and then merged back into Master and Development branches.
						</small>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases. Hotfix branches are a lot like release
						branches and feature branches except they're based on master instead of develop. This is the only branch that should
						fork directly off of master. As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and develop.</aside>

				<h3>The overall flow of Gitflow is:</h3>
				<small>
					<ul>
						<li>A develop branch is created from master</li>
						<li>A release branch is created from develop</li>
						<li>Feature branches are created from develop</li>
						<li>When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch</li>
						<li>When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master</li>
						<li>If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master</li>
						<li>Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master</li>
