While I have taken classes that require some programming, I consider myself a self-taught programmer. I've spent seven years in Operations creating tools to solve the most annoying problems. Most of them are defunct now but I solved a problem and learned something in the process.

I have completed projects using web, arduino, and data-visualization.

## Coding Club objective

I want to share the tools and resources that I've learned and would like to have the group share resources with each other and use the expertise at the lab to learn new tools. I often start trying to solve a problem only to have someone say, "That problem has already been solved" or "Why are you doing it that way?".

## Tools

Everyday I use tools like:

- Google
- Stack Exchange
- YouTube
- Podcasts

## Google Tips

Word choice can change results, but Google is always getting better. There are also neat features like searching for "rice nutritional info".

- Use simple language
- Quotes
  - "I need this exact phrase"
- Site search
  - site:fnal.gov cafeteria menu
- Exclude terms
  - Ford Mustang -red
- OR operator
  - puppies OR kittens OR dolphins
- Wildcard
  - how to find \* on Google

## Stack Exchange

Stack Exchange is a self-moderating question-and-answer site.

There are many Stack Exchange sites to explore. Stack Overflow is the first and largest.

Quora is another great one that I stumble across through Google searches but I haven't submitted questions or answers.
